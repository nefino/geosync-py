# Nefino Geosync

This is a tool for downloading geodata from Nefino using an API key.
A Nefino API contract is required.

Project goals:
- cross-platform
- easily readable and modifiable to suit your needs
- use bandwidth efficiently
- downloading all updateable layers regularly should be easy.

## Quickstart

1. Get an API key from https://nefino.li/account/api-keys
2. on the server you want to save the geodata to, run nefino-geosync in a command line and answer the questions (they are then saved)
3. set up a scheduled task to run nefino-geosync regularly
