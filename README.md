# Nefino Geosync

This is a tool for downloading geodata from Nefino using an API key.
A Nefino API contract is required.

We support Windows, MacOS, and Linux.

Note: to conserve resources, you should only run geosync on one computer.

## Quickstart

1. Get an API key from https://nefino.li/account/api-keys
2. install nefino-geosync
3. on the server you want to save the geodata to, run nefino-geosync in a command line and answer the questions (they are then saved)
4. set up a scheduled task to run nefino-geosync regularly
